This project is a simple HTML-based page that presents a layout for the weekly portions of the Torah (parashot). The layout includes organized text segments to enhance readability and immersion in the scriptural passages.

The narrative text is arranged in paragraphs without styling, while the voices of the various characters (quotations) are contained in colored frames. Blue is reserved for Hashem and other heavenly figures, while green is for righteous people and red for the wicked. Other colors are used to distinguish characters when needed.
